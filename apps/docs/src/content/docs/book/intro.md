You should work through the [SST Guide](https://sst.dev/guide.html) prior to begining this book. At a very minimum you should work through creating a [react app](https://sst.dev/examples/how-to-create-a-reactjs-app-with-serverless.html) with SST.

## What's the purpose of this book

The goal is provide a path for someone who becomes interested in SST and is mostly a front end developer to be able to build a SaaS by themselves. This is internal documentation for me as much as it's a tool for you. The goal is not provide a path for every possible thing. SaaS is generally pretty straightforwad with it's needs. An SPA is great for SaaS, we don't need server side rendering, so we don't use it. At all. That doesn't mean it's not important, it's just not important for this project. Instead, we add an Astro Site so that we have have a marketing site.

## I want to use

### Svelte

Okay! This book is not for you.

### NextJS

Okay! This book is not for you.

### ...

This is an opinionated set of directions for making SaaS apps built on top of SST. It's my opinions. There is a tutorials section set up that perhaps some day can add in other tools. If you want to write one, please feel welcome to. That said, we're focusing on my opinons here.

## Buy a domain from AWS

Go buy a domain from AWS. There are other providers. If you want to use them... This book is not for you. It's like $11. You need it now. Go do it. I'll wait.

Okay, got it? Great!

Let's get started.
